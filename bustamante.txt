**Dream:**
I see myself as a UI/UX Designer in the future. I enjoy creating simple, user-friendly, and visually appealing designs that make technology easier for people to use. 
UI/UX combines creativity and problem-solving, which fits my strengths and interests. I want to design applications and websites that not only look good but also provide a smooth and meaningful experience for users. 
Another reason why I see myself in UI/UX is because I am passionate about understanding people’s needs. I believe that technology should be designed around the user, not the other way around. By focusing on user-centered design, I can contribute to products that make people’s daily tasks faster, easier, and even enjoyable
