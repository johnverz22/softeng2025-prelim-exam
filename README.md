**Dream:**  
I see myself becoming a Full-Stack Developer who can design and develop projects on any platform. I want this role because I find learning anything that is coding related enjoyable at first I didn't know where to focus on because I enjoy building mobile, desktop, cybersecurity, designing, backend, and etc. I really want to do all of them not because I want to master them all but because I find enjoyment in learning them and applying them to projects.
