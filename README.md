#Dream 

I see myself becoming a QA Tester who ensures the quality and reliability of software products.

I want this role because I value precision, attention to detail, and problem-solving. I enjoy finding errors, analyzing systems, and making sure 
that products work as expected before they reach users.

My goal is to help development teams deliver bug-free, efficient, and user-friendly applications. 
I also want to contribute to improving testing processes and tools that make software more stable and secure.

As technology continues to advance, quality assurance is vital for building trust with users. 
I believe I can make a difference by ensuring every product I test meets the highest standards.
