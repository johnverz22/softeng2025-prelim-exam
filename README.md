**Dream:**                 
As my college years went by I started to learn what roles I liked and didnt. The number 1 role that made me pursue computer science is software architect. I realized that my strength was designing and coding wasnt really my forte. In second year I honed my talent for designing. In third year I faced my weakness and pushed myself to upskill. Now I dream of being a full-stack developer and eventually become a software architect as I love handling things and being able to thrive for the result that I want.
