**Dream:**  
I see myself becoming a Software Engineer specializing in mobile and web applications.  
I chose this path because I enjoy solving problems through technology, and I want to build apps that can improve peopleâ€™s daily lives.  
My goal is to continuously grow my skills, contribute to innovative projects, and help shape the future of technology in a meaningful way.
