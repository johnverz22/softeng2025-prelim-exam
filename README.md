# Trinidad, Mark Andrei H. / Marketuc

**Dream:**
I see myself going into an IT field that specializes in data.

I want this role because I have always liked my statistics and probablity class in high school 
and have liked it ever since, There is just something about handling big amounts of data and 
processing them that piques my interest

My goal is to be succesful in that field and eventually 
be in a big company and handle all of their data
