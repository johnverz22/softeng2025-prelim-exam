I see myself in the IT industry as a QA tester. I believe this role suits me because I have a strong attention to detail and patience, which are essential qualities for ensuring that applications and systems run smoothly. As a QA tester, I would play a vital role in detecting errors, bugs, and usability issues before a product is released, which contributes to creating reliable and high-quality software for users.

One of the compelling reasons I want to pursue this path is because I enjoy analyzing and solving problems. I find satisfaction in ensuring that technology works the way it is intended and provides the best possible user experience. This role also offers opportunities for continuous learning, as new tools and testing methods are always being developed, which makes the career both challenging and rewarding.

Furthermore, being a QA tester allows me to work collaboratively with developers, designers, and project managers, which helps me grow professionally and improve my communication and teamwork skills. It also provides me with a sense of responsibility and fulfillment knowing that my contributions directly improve the quality of a product. In the future, I aim to grow in this field and possibly advance into roles like QA lead or automation engineer, which would give me more influence in shaping the quality standards of software systems.
