**Dream:**  
I see myself as a **Frontend Developer** who crafts user interfaces that are highly accessible, visually appealing, and responsive across all devices.  

My dream is to create digital experiences where technology feels natural and intuitive, so users don’t have to struggle to achieve their goals.  

I want this role because it blends creativity and logic — designing beautiful layouts combined with writing clean, efficient code.  

I believe my passion for design systems, performance optimization, and accessibility can help bridge the gap between people and technology. My ultimate goal is to be one of those developers who make users say: *“Well, that was easy.”*
