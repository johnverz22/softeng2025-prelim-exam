Dream:
I see myself becoming a Website or UI/UX Designer who creates layouts and design solutions for better user experiences.

I want this role because it allows me to be creative while also considering the needs of the users of my projects. I also enjoy getting feedback from others in order to improve user flow in my designs.

My goal is to enhance user experiences, especially for those who are unable or are struggling to keep up with the constant upgrades innovation brings.
