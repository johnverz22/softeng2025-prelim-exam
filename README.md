### Dream
I see myself becoming a software engineer, specifically developing a new tooling software for developing applications. 
I chose this role because I want to develop tools and software that can provide improvements to peoples activities that uses computers. I enjoy the process of software development, and learning new techniques or adapting new process for my development journey.
My goal is to make open source software that are aimed to bridge compatibilities with linux and windows user.
The IT industry is always divided with their systems of choice and development of application for both are a difficult and often frustrating. This is where I think I can add most value to the industry.
