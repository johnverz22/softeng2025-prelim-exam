**Dream:**
I foresee myself as a Software Engineer, a Freelancer, who handles the front-end and back-end of my own project with my own or a certain company

My goal right now is to focus on the important stuff like being Laravel Front-end and Back-end to be able to adapt to the future and be able to compete and qualify in the IT industry
