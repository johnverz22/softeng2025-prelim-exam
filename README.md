**Dream:**

I see myself becoming a Mobile Developer who belongs on a team that creates meaningful applications.

I want this role because during my return to school after stopping for years, it is the role that I am exposed to.

My goal is to learn more and advance my career through hard work and learning.

The IT industry is developing fast with advancements being delivered quickly. I want to be able to follow what's new and advance my skills.
