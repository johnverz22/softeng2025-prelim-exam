Dream:
I see myself as a busines owner and an working in a company 

i want this role because it will help me grow and enhance my communication with others and enjoy working with other people as much as i enjoy working with my sysstems and project in our company

My goal is to guide project from to completion and i also want to help people grow like i did and guide and motivate others so they can grow and learn how fun it is to be a developer

The IT industry is growing fast, and companies need people who can bridge the gap between technical experts and business goals. I believe this is where I can add the most value.
