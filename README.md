## Dream:
I see myself becoming an IT Project Manager who leads teams in building solutions that solve real problems for people and organizations.
I want this role because it combines leadership, technology, and communication. I enjoy working with people as much as I enjoy working with systems, and project management allows me to do both.
My goal is to guide projects from planning to completion, making sure they meet deadlines, budgets, and quality standards. I also want to create an environment where every team member feels valued and motivated.
The IT industry is growing fast, and companies need people who can bridge the gap between technical experts and business goals. 
I believe this is where I can add the most value.
