**Dream:**
I see myself becoming an pilot rather than being in IT Industry.

But being an IT student in Lorma Colleges, reminds me when I was young. Being obsessed with computers. I love computers, I was obsessed with it becuase my tito built one.

My goal is to become one of the best IT graduates that is based here in La Union.

IT Industry is becoming a big thing this 20th century. More stuff are being develop to expand more knowledge to become a better world. So be it.
