**Dream:**  
I see myself becoming a Database Manager who oversees and maintains secure, efficient, and reliable data systems for organizations.  
This role aligns with my passion for organizing information, ensuring data integrity, and optimizing system performance. I enjoy solving complex data-related problems and making sure that mission-critical systems run smoothly.  
As a Database Manager, I aim to design scalable database architectures, implement robust backup and recovery solutions, and lead a team that values data security and availability.  
With the growing reliance on data in decision-making and digital transformation, I believe this role allows me to contribute significantly to any organization's success. My goal is to ensure that data is not only safe but also actionable and accessible to those who need it.
